		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		In order to rasterize a triangle given the x's and y's of a triangle's three vertices, I basically take each point in the image and determine where each point lies relative to each of the three lines in the triangle.  Each line of the triangle creates two opposite planes, and all the points inside the triangle will be on the same side of each of the lines (when the lines are formed clockwise or counterclockwise).  When plugged into the line test formula, when the three tests come out as all positive or all negative, it means that the point is inside the triangle. <br>
		<br>
		In my case, I wanted to count points as inside the triangle when the center of its pixel (x+0.5, y+0.5) was inside.  My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle, because that is exacly what I did: I found the min and max x's and y's and only checked the points within that area.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		In order to antialias my triangles, I performed supersampling by assigning color values to each pixel depending on the amount of subpixels that are wtihin the triangle.  The basic idea behind supersampling here is that I increased the resolution of the image by a factor of some 'sample_rate' and rasterized on this bigger image.  Then, I assigned each pixel the average color value of its subpixels, so that pixels along the jagged edges would look less jagged because the on-the-border edges would have muted colors. <br>
		<br>
		The modifications to the original pipeline were the inclusion of subpixel values in the run-through of the three line test as well as the filling of these subpixels.  I also had to update fill_pixel(), resolve_to_framebuffer(), set_framebuffer_target(), and set_sample_rate() to work with my supersampling code.  <br>
		<br>
		The figures below show basic test 4 at different rates of supersampling (1, 4, 16).  The higher the rate, the more subpixels were used.  This means that images with higher rates have smoother edges and less or no gaps, especially when comparing very small corners of triangles.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		My goal was transform cubeman to make it look like it is doing a handstand.  I rotated the whole torso by 180 degrees and then rotated the left and right arms and forearms so I could see the bend in its arms.  I had to adjust the translation for the forearms a little bit because they were rotating out of its elbow socket.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		Barycentric coordinates are a way of representing a point through its relation to its surrounding triangle's vertices.  In this way, a point's position is relative to its distance to the three vertices.  If I say that each vertex represents a different color, each point's three 'distance' values can represent a color value instead, taking on a combination of the vertices' colors depending on its closeness to them. <br>
		<br>
		The below triangle has vertices that are red, blue, and green, and as I move across the triangle, the individual rbg color values change with its distance to each vertex.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel sampling is a way of determining the color of a pixel in order to create texture in an image.  It is a way to 'wrap' a 2d image onto a 3d object.  I basically took the coordinates from the higher object and turned them into texture coordinates that are able to be mapped onto a texture to find its new color value. The two pixel sampling methods I used were nearest sampling, which pulls from the nearest color on the texture, and bilinear sampling, which interpolates between the 4 pixels around it. <br>
		<br>
		Shown below are a comparison between combinations of nearest and bilinear sampling as well as 1 and 16 samples per pixel on texmap2.  When comparing nearest to bilinear, the bilinear side has much more smooth lines, especially when looking at the skinny latitude and longitude lines which are clearly more jagged on the nearest.  Similarly, the 16 samples are much more clear and smooth than the 1 sample ones. Large differences appear between these pictures when closely examining or zooming in on the edges and skinny lines.  This is because adding samples and doing bilinear generally increase blending and smoothing out of lines in order to decrease jaggies.

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling is used to create the sense of depth and distance on a textured object by applying a slight blur that comes with distance, similarly to real life. It generally makes objects closer in distance have full resolution while blurring further away points.  In order to do this, I utilize a mipmap, which is a set of the same texture at varying resolutions.  Using Barycentric coordinates, I am able to take a point and calculate where on the texture the point will lie and therefore what level it will be at. I used two pixel sampling methods (nearest and linear) and three level sampling methods (zero, nearest, and linear). A few combinations are shown below.  <br>
		<br>
		In comparing pixel sampling, level sampling, and supersampling by their relative speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power, pixel sampling seems very fast with minimal memory usage, but does not seem as powerful for antialiasing compared to the higher levels of level sampling and supersampling.  Level sampling has much more calculations than pixel sampling and takes more memory, but is stronger and is able to do more work on an image.  The supersampling I implemented has a higher ceiling in terms of performance if I continually increase the sample rate, but that comes with the detriment of being much slower and costly in terms of memory.
