		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, I have worked with light, scenes, and coordinate spaces in order to create very realistic 3d scenes that utilize light to give the scenes depth, texture, and color. To start, I worked on simple structures to build on later like camera rays and pixel samples, and I formulated functions to highlight intersections between rays and objects like triangles and spheres, giving a basic form of light in a 3d space.  Following this, I constructed a Bounding Volume Hierarchy as well as bounding box and bvh intersection functions to support it. This greatly speeds up rendering time and allows me to create more complex images. <br><br>
		I then moved on to illumination to really give my scenes depth and interaction with light.  Working on diffuse BSDF's, I developed direct lighting with both uniform hemisphere sampling as well as importance sampling, giving my structures a feeling of realism as the light in the scene interacts with its objects. In conjunction with the direct light, I then implemented indirect light which together gives my scenes global illumination.  With this, I can also control how many bounces of light to use, making all parts of the scene seem more full and clear.  In order to allow for a more random form of ray depth, I added in the russian roulette feature that allows for a random depth based on coinflips. All of this put together gives me so much variety and flexibility in how I am able to generate scenes. Lastly, I made adaptive sampling for the purpose of giving certain areas of the scene that need more sampling points and parts that don't need it less points, allowing for a much more clear result without a huge cost.   <br><br>
		I have learned a lot in this homework about illumination and sampling, and I am very happy learning that there are so many methods available for me to develop, optimize, and customize scenes and images to my liking. I can combine methods together and use them in tandem, which makes the final results so satisfying. I also feel like I learned so much about lights and how they can be used to create such realistic scenes. <br><br>


		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		Generating camera rays involves taking image coordinates and transforming them into a world space ray. My process took the 1 by 1 square image space and translated it into the virtual camera sensor, being able to scale and transform the inputs.  Then I configured the new ray with parameters based on the transformed input as well as other Camera variables.  In order to generate pixel samples, I did a Monte Carlo estimate of the vector value of the pixel in order to estimate the integral of radiance over it. For the given pixel, I would generate a certai amounts of samples and average them to get the final pixel value.  <br><br>
		
		For ray-triangle intersection, I implemented the Moller-Trumbore algorithm which is an optimized way to find the time t and two of the barycentric coordinates of the intersection. Generally, it involves taking the equation of a ray and the equation of a plane and solving for an intersection using vector operations like dot product, cross product, and others.  The calculations allow us to get the time at which the ray hits the triangle, as well as the two (the third is 1-b1-b2) barycentric coordinates of the intersection. For the ray-sphere intersection, I do a similar process which is solving for the intersection of the given ray and sphere using their equations.  This results in a quadratic for which I use the quadratic equation to solve if it has 0, 1, or 2 intersections. 0 means it does not intersect.  1 means it intersects one time tangentially, and 2 means it goes through the sphere so I take the closest one.    <br><br>

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		In order to construct my bounding volume hierarchy, I employed a recursive algorithm to create and traverse this binary tree. Given the start/end of a Primitive vector and the max leaf size as well as the BVHAccel class, I first create a bounding box over all of the primitives inputted in.  Then, I create a new node that will be mutated and returned later, starting the recursion process.  If the max leaf size is greater than the amount of primitives left in the iterator, then the node is a leaf node.  If not, the I proceed onto the splitting part.   <br><br>
		The heuristic I chose in order to find the splitting point is the average of the centroids along the largest axis.  Following this, I put primitives into a left vector and a right one depending on their position compared to the splitting point.  Then, I pass the new set of primitives into a recursive call to construct the other leaves.  <br><br>

		Compared to the rendering times in part 1, the Bounding Volume Hierarchy acceleration significantly optimizes rendering scenes with moderately complex geometries. For instance, the cow goes from 21.2960s to a 0.0820s rendering time. Similarly, the beast, a more complex geometry, goes from 276.3363s to 0.0701s. Lastly, even the teapot goes from 8.8300s to 0.0682s. The PathTracer information printed for me during rendering shows how for the beast's BVH acceleration, the average speed was almost 6 million rays per second whereas its original speed was 0.0016 million rays per second, showing such a huge difference. All of the BVH accelerations dropped the times to less than a second whereas you can see that without it, the more complex geometries can get into super long rendering times.  <br><br>

		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
		To implement direct lighting with uniform hemisphere sampling, I am estimating the light that reaches the camera from some intersection point that is reflecting light.  The process involves sampling a certain amount of rays that would reach the camera from the intersection point, which in this case is a uniform sample from the hemisphere. Then I check if these samples then intersect an light source (i.e. a light would shine on a reflection point which would secondarily shine onto the camera). Then, I use these values to form the Monte Carlo estimator for the reflection equation, estimating the light in the scene.  <br><br>

		The direct lighting by importance sampling is a similar process and structure to the previous method. The main difference is that I am sampling all of the lights directly, the main purpose being that it allows for lights originating from a single point. The main idea of this method is that I am sampling light rays and seeing if they hit the hit point, i.e. seeing if light is being shone on them.  In this method, I sample a certain amount from each light source, and only adding the light reflection term if the light ray is not intersecting another object on the way to the point.  Then, I can calculate the Monte Carlo estimator for the reflection equation like before. <br><br>

		Comparing the uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling, sampling the lights themselves clearly make a huge difference in the results as well as allowing for point lights whereas uniform hemisphere sampling basically makes it impossible to find the point lights.  When comparing these two sampling methods with the exact same parameters, the importance sampling has strikingly better results visually.  There is much less static in the importance sampling and a much clearer rendering overall.  It also took a shorter amount of time to render, which is surprising because of how much of a visual difference there is. Even the testing images that I used for the importance sampling one, which was using 1 camera ray per pixel, 1 sample per area light, and 1 max ray depth, was not much worse than some of the uniform hemisphere results.  <br><br>

		I focused on the dragon scene and rendered with 1 sample per pixel and 1/4/16/64 light rays using direct lighting importance sampling as shown below. With only one light ray, the image is very noisy with only the main shapes and most contrasting shadows being super discernable.  As I add more light rays, the image becomes much smoother and the noise goes down considerably.  The soft shadows are much clearer which make the areas with a lighter shadow more defined compared to the previous iterations.  An example of this can be seen if you compare the shadow behind (the the top left of) the dragon which is not noticeable in the 1 light ray one but very clear in the 64 ray image.  <br><br>

		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		In order to get global illumination, I link the direct illumination created in the previous part to a new indirect illumination which builds off of the one_bounce_radiance function I made before.  My new function which supports multiple bounces of light rays recursively adds a term from Monte Carlo sum of paths which accumulates the amount of light on an object by how the light source's rays reach it.  It is generally a similar structure to the one_bounce_radiance function from before as it finds a direction sample from the intersection point and makes a new ray. Then, I add the point's one_bounce_radiance as well as the result from the recursive call over the new ray along with multiplicative factors like the light sample, cos theta, and pdf. Then the light can build up over time and places unable to be reached by direct light can be illuminated.   <br><br>

		I also had to account for other factors like the maximum depth which returns at a certain amount of bounces, a russian roulette feature which returned the light value randomly to allow for random bounce depths, and the isAccumBounces boolean which, if false, only shows the light from the depth set by the max_ray_depth which shows isolated light bounce levels. <br><br>

		The following spheres scene compares direct illumination versus indirect illumination. The direct scene has more vivid colors and lights whereas the indirect scene is more dull and muted.  This is because the indirect scene is only getting secondhand light reflection, not from the source directly. <br><br>

		Below shows CBbunny rendered with (0,1,2,3,4,5) bounces of light (max_ray_depth), first without accumulating bounces and then with accumulating bounces. When isolating the 2nd and 3rd bounce of light in the non-accumulating bunny images, the color of the walls start to bleed onto the bunny as the light reflected the color from the walls onto the bunny.  This by itself gives an edge over rasterization because it would be very difficult for rasterization to receive information from across the scene, showing how light rays seem to be a very easy way of showing realism in light and color reflection.  <br><br>

		Comparing the accumulating vs the unaccumulating bounces, the unaccumulating images become dull quickly as the light is fading seen through comparing 1 bounce to 2 bounces.  On the other hand, the accumulating images keep their color and light very well, the thing fading the most over bounces being the color contrast.  By the end, the image has less contrasting colors than before but the walls are more colored than the unaccumulated. <br><br>

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
		Adaptive sampling is a solution to reducing noise and helping with clarity in generating realistic images.  Its main purpose is to be able to increase sampling in areas that need it without having to increase the sampling everywhere, reducing work while still being able to have very clear parts in dense areas. Instead of going over all num_samples possible, I take samples until an inequality based in a confidence interval is satisfied.  The inequality includes terms like the sample mean, the sample standard deviation, the current number of samples, and the max tolerance, all values given or able to be calculated because I kept variables for the sum of all samples and the sum of all squared samples (which I can put into a formula). So that I am not recalculating the inequality every time, I batch sample in groups of samplesPerBatch, each time taking a sample, forming a sample ray, finding the sample's radiance, and updating the sample, mean, and sd variables accordingly.  Then I increment and check the inequality until it is satisfied, which allows me to update the pixel and the count buffer for the rate image.  <br><br>

		Below are two scenes, bunny and spheres, that utilize adaptive sampling alongside their sampling rate images. They are both 2048 samples per pixel, 1 sample per light, and 5 max ray depth.    <br><br>
